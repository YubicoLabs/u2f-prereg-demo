Preregistration Demo
====================

This is a small fork of `Yubico/java-webauthn-server` that demonstrates how to load U2F preregistration data into a
WebAuthn server.

The important new/modified pieces of code are `U2fVerifier.verifyPreregistration`, `WebAuthnServer.addPreregistration`,
and `U2FPreregistrationResponse`.

=== Usage

1. First, use the `YubicoLabs/yubikey-se-tool` and a YubiKey to generate a TSV file containing U2F preregistration data.
   We will call this file `preregdata.tsv`.
2. To start the demo server, run `./gradlew run`. This will start the server on `localhost:8443`.
3. After the server starts, we will associate the preregistration with a new user with username 'sam'. Run the
`load-preregistration.sh` script as follows (you should get a success message after running it):

        ./load-preregistration.sh localhost:8443 preregdata.tsv sam

4. Now, in a browser you can navigate to https://localhost:8443, and then supply 'sam' as the username and click
'Authenticate'. You should be successfully authenticated.
